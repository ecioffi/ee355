The program with the recursive algorithm took ~46 seconds to process 10000 random numbers ranging from 0 to 100000. The dynamic one took only ~36 seconds for the same set of numbers. This is explained by a complexity analysis of the algorithms. The recursive Fibonacci procedure calls itself twice, so it spawns an expanding tree of recursion. Its runtime complexity is roughly O(1.7^n). The dynamic approach is a simple loop, so its complexity is roughly linear, or O(n). Thus, given large numbers, the recursive approach is expected to be measurably slower, and it is.
